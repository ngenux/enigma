# Project Branching Workflow for Team

## Introduction
This branching workflow is designed to keep the codebase stable and ensure that new features are thoroughly reviewed before being merged into the main codebase.

## Main Branch
The `main` branch is the main branch where the codebase is considered as stable. Only completed features should be merged into this branch.

## Development Branch
The `development` branch is where all active development should take place. When starting a new feature, each developer should create their own feature branch off the development branch.

## Feature Branch
Each developer should create their own feature branch off the development branch and work on their own feature. The naming convention for feature branches should be `feature/{feature-name}`.

## Pull Request
After a feature is complete, the developer should submit a pull request to merge the feature branch into the development branch. At least one other team member should review the code before it is merged.

## Merge
Once the pull request is approved, the development branch should be merged with the main branch.

## Conclusion
By following this branching workflow, we can ensure that the main branch is always in a stable state and that new features are thoroughly reviewed before being merged into the main codebase.
